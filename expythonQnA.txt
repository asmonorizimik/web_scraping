Q.1. What are the key features of Python?

If it makes for an introductory language to programming, Python must mean something. These are its qualities:

Interpreted
Dynamically-typed
Object-oriented
Concise and simple
Free
Has a large community


2.The ternary operator in Python is nothing but a one-line version of the if-else statement. It provides a way to write conditional statements in a single line
It takes binary value(condition) as an input, so it looks similar to an “if-else” condition block
# tenery operator
# a,b=2,3
# min=a if a>b else b
# print(min)



3.dentifier: name of the varables

4.What is the pass statement in Python?
There may be times in our code when we haven’t decided what to do yet, but we must type something for it to be syntactically correct. In such a case, we use the pass statement.

5.To find out which directory in python you are currently in, use the getcwd() method. Cwd is for current working directory in python. This returns the path of the current
python directory as a string in Python.
A directory or folder is a collection of files and subdirectories. Python has the os module that provides us with many useful methods to work with directories (and files as well).



6.How will you remove a duplicate element from a list?
We can turn it into a set to do that.
>>> list=[1,2,1,3,4,2]
>>> set(list)
{1, 2, 3, 4}




7.AND (&) This performs & on each bit pair.
>>> 0b110 & 0b010
2

OR (|) This performs | on each bit pair.
>>> 3|2
3

XOR (^) This performs an exclusive-OR operation on each bit pair.
>>> 3^2
1

Binary One’s Complement (~) This returns the one’s complement of a value.
>>> ~2
-3

Binary Left-Shift (<<) This shifts the bits to the left by the specified amount.
>>> 1<<2
4

Here, 001 was shifted to the left by two places to get 100, which is binary for 4.

Binary Right-Shift (>>)
>>> 4>>2
1


8.What is a docstring?

A docstring is a documentation string that we use to explain what a construct does. We place it as the first thing under a function, class, or a method, to describe what it does. We declare a docstring using three sets of single or double-quotes.
>>> def sayhi():
"""
The function prints Hi
"""
print("Hi")
>>> sayhi()



9.Write code to print only upto the letter t.
>>> i=0
>>> while s[i]!='t':
print(s[i],end=’’)
i+=1
I love Py



10. Write code to print everything in the string except the spaces.
>>> for i in s:
if i==' ': continue
print(i,end='')
IlovePython




11.What is the purpose of bytes() in Python?
bytes() is a built-in function in Python that returns an immutable bytes object. Let’s take an example.
>>> bytes([2,4,8])
b’\x02\x04\x08′
>>> bytes(5)
b’\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00′
>>> bytes('world','utf-8')
b’world’



12.Create a new list to convert the following list of number strings to a list of numbers.
nums=[‘22’,’68’,’110’,’89’,’31’,’12’]
We will use the int() function with a list comprehension to convert these strings into integers and put them in a list.
>>> [int(i) for i in nums]
[22, 68, 110, 89, 31, 12]


13.How many types of objects does Python support?
Objects in Python are mutable and immutable. Let’s talk about these.
Immutable objects- Those which do not let us modify their contents. Examples of these will be tuples, booleans, strings, integers, floats, and complexes. Iterations on such objects are faster.
>>> tuple=(1,2,4)
>>> tuple
(1, 2, 4)
>>> 2+4j
(2+4j)
Mutable objects – Those that let you modify their contents. Examples of these are lists, sets, and dicts. Iterations on such objects are slower.
>>> [2,4,9]
[2, 4, 9]
>>> dict1={1:1,2:2}
>>> dict1
{1: 1, 2: 2}
While two equal immutable objects’ reference variables share the same address, it is possible to create two mutable objects with the same content.



14.What makes Python object-oriented?
Again the frequently asked Python Interview Question
Python is object-oriented because it follows the Object-Oriented programming paradigm. 
This is a paradigm that revolves around classes and their instances (objects). With this kind of programming, we have the following features:
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Data hiding





2. Explain Web Scraping Procedure.
There are multiple steps involved in web scraping:
Reading data (source code of the web page URL) from the website
Parsing this data based on the HTML tags
Storing or displaying desired scraped information
Scraped data is very useful in data analytics.



Q. What are the Python libraries you have used for web scrapping?
There are many Python libraries are available for web scrapping like…
Beautiful Soap and Scrappy are the two most useful Python modules for scrapping web information.
The request module is to read the data from internet web pages.
JSON library is used to dump, to read and to write the JSON formatting objects.



Q. What is the purpose of the request module in Python?
The request module is used to read the data from the internet web pages. 
You have to pass the URL from where you want to read the data along with the HTTP request method, 
header information like encoding method, response data format, and session cookies…

In the HTTP response, you get data from the website. Data can be in any format like string, 
JSON, XML and YAML; based on data format mentioned in the request and server response.



7. What are the different HTTP response status codes?
When you send the HTTP request to read the data from the internet, you get the response along with the different response status.

Every status code has its meaning.

get:It is use to access resources amd to know the state of particular resources
head: This method request the header which is required for the client and server communication.
post: It performs operations on a resource like creating and updating resource properties


How to deal if your IP address is blocked by the website?
 =>Proxy IPs/servers can be used to access the web pages if your IP address is blocked.
 Usually, data analytics companies web scraps millions of web pages. Many times their IP addresses get blocked. 
 To overcome this they use a VPN (Virtual Private Network). There are many VPN service providers.

How does VPN work?
You send a request to the VPN server. 
It reads the data from the website. VPN sends back the response to your IP address.
You can see, VPN actually hides your IP address from the website server and they will never come to know about your 
IP address. VPN has a pool of IP addresses. Even if the VPN IP address gets blocked, they can use another IP address from the pool.


Q.Write a Python program to extract h1 tag from example.com.
from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
html = urlopen('http://www.example.com/')
bsh = BeautifulSoup(html.read(), 'html.parser')
print(bsh.h1)


urllib.request — Extensible library for opening URLs.
The urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in 
opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.



Q. What is a robots.txt file? 
Robots.txt is a text file that tells crawlers, bots, or spiders if a website could be or how it should be scrapped as 
specified by the website owner. It is critical to understand the robots.txt file to prevent being blocked while web scraping.
